## Lab 01:
it took me around three hours to complete it well the delay was because of My IDE it had some issues but solved with the help of a TA. I used 3 methods:

1. pluralize method
2. flipNHeads method
3. clock method
And i ran these two commands javac Main.java and java Main.java and the program works perfectly /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

## Lab 02:
It took me 5 hours to complete not for the complexity of the code but the problem was the IDE that caused a lot of delay to finish the lab. In this lab i added 4 methods:

1. roll
2. containsDuplicates
3. calculateAvg
4. arrayOfArrays
And i was able to run a test and everything is working fine with my code

## Lab 03:
It took me 5 hours to complete i faced some diffeculties with the file I/O but i was able to add 3 more methods today:
1. tempMethod
2. tally
3. linterMethod: Linter method is ready but i was not able to read from the file provided.
And i was able to run a test on 1,2 but linter method i was not able since i had the problem.
